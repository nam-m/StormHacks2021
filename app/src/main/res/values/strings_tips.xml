    <string name="tip_1">
        You don\'t have to be face-to-face to check in on a friend of loved one,
        and keeping up social connection is particularly important during stressful times.
        Phone calls and social networks are a great stress-busting,
        mood-boosting way to spend time with the people you love.

        Staying active is as good for the brain as it is for the body.
        Regular exercise or activity can have a major impact on your mental and emotional health,
        relieve stress, improve memory, and help you sleep better.

        If you\'re self-isolating or the usual place you exercise is closed,
        there are many ways you can keep fit at home such as climbing the stairs
        or following free tutorials through Youtube.

        If you are not self-isolating, it is still recommended to stretch your legs
        outside while maintaining a safe social distance of two metres from others.

        It\'s easy to get sucked in to reading constant updates on social media,
        this can be mentally draining as well as putting you at risk of seeing false information.

        A better way to stay informed is by checking out credible sources once or twice a day for updates.
        Some reliable sources include:

        <a href="http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19">BC Centre for Disease Control</a>
        <a href="https://www.who.int">The World Health Organization</a>
        <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19.html">Health Canada</a>

        Remember, the information absorb can affect how we feel. We should monitor what we read with care.

        It matters more than you think. One way to get sleep better is to take a break from the
        stimulation of screens — TV, phones, tablets or computers — in the two hours before bedtime.

        Focus on positive thoughts. Choose to focus on the positive things in your life, instead of dwelling on how bad you feel.
        Consider starting each day by listing things you are thankful for. Maintain a sense of hope, work to accept changes as
        they occur and try to keep problems in perspective.
    </string>

    <string name='tip_10'>
        Set priorities. Don\'t become overwhelmed by creating a life-changing list of things to achieve while you\'re home. Set reasonable goals
        each day and outline steps you can take to reach those goals. Give yourself credit for every step in the right direction,
        no matter how small. And recognize that some days will be better than others.
